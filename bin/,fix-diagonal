# Fix an Instagram image that they have skewed into a diagonal image.
# One principle:
#
# First row of pixels has a hot pixel at index -2.
# Second row of pixels has a hot pixel at index -3.
# ...
# Next-to-last row of pixels has a hot pixel at index 0.
# Bottom row of pixels is not harmed.
#
# Another principle:
#
# Surprisingly, data to the right of the hot pixel belongs next to the
# *previous* row's pixels that are left of its hot pixel.
